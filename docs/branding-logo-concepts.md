## Color Palette Recommendations

Based on the landslide simulator's technical and natural themes:

### Primary Colors
- **Earth Browns:** `#8B4513`, `#A0522D`, `#6B4423`
- **Vegetation Greens:** `#00C853`, `#4CAF50`, `#2E7D32`
- **Water/Rain Blues:** `#0288D1`, `#03A9F4`, `#006064`

### Accent Colors
- **Warning/Unstable:** `#FF5722`, `#F44336`, `#D32F2F`
- **Stable/Safe:** `#4CAF50`, `#8BC34A`
- **Neutral Tones:** Tailwind `neutral` palette (as per brand guidelines)

### Modern Gradients
- Stability → Instability: `#00C853` → `#FFAB00` → `#FF5722`
- Depth gradient: `#1A237E` → `#0288D1` → `#80DEEA`
- Earth gradient: `#3E2723` → `#8D6E63` → `#A1887F`

## Usage Guidelines

1. **3D Renders:** Best for app store icons, promotional materials, hero images
2. **2.5D Designs:** Ideal for dashboard UI, loading states, tutorial graphics
3. **2D Vectors:** Perfect for favicon, small icons, monochrome contexts, print materials

All concepts prioritize scalability, clarity at small sizes (64px), and alignment with the neutral-palette professional aesthetic defined in CLAUDE.md.
